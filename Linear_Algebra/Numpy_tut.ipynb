    "# NUMPY\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is a Python library that provides a simple yet powerful data structure: the n-dimensional array. This is the foundation on which almost all the power of Python’s data science toolkit is built, and learning NumPy is the first step on any Python data scientist’s journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the top *four benefits* that NumPy can bring to your code:\n",
    "- **More speed**: NumPy uses algorithms written in C that complete in nanoseconds rather than seconds.\n",
    "- **Fewer loops**: NumPy helps you to reduce loops and keep from getting tangled up in iteration indices.\n",
    "- **Clearer code**: Without loops, your code will look more like the equations you’re trying to calculate.\n",
    "- **Better quality**: There are thousands of contributors working to keep NumPy fast, friendly, and bug free.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of these benefits, NumPy is the de facto standard for multidimensional arrays in Python data science, and many of the most popular libraries are built on top of it. Learning NumPy is a great way to set down a solid foundation as you expand your knowledge into more specific areas of data science.Because of these benefits, NumPy is the de facto standard for multidimensional arrays in Python data science, and many of the most popular libraries are built on top of it.

    "\n",
    "It’ll be a relatively rudimentary curve, though. You’ll take whatever the average score is and declare that a C. Additionally, you’ll make sure that the curve doesn’t accidentally hurt your students’ grades or help so much that the student does better than 100%."

They have to be the same underlying C type, with the same shape and size in bits!"
